Ed Dawson's OLED-Accelerometer-Compass Project: 
Based on the Adafruit FLORA Arduino compatible:
(see http://www.adafruit.com/products/659 )
Wiring: Uses Pin 10 for OLED_RESET ("Rst" pinout on FLORA board) 
instead of Pin 4 as per the Adafruit default code (for Arduino Uno). 
Takes readings from the Adafruit FLORA accelerometer LSM303 
(see http://www.adafruit.com/products/1247 ) 
and displays them on the Adafruit 128-64 pixel OLED display 
(see http://www.adafruit.com/products/326 ). 
(this code is based on from the Adafruit example code for these components.)
